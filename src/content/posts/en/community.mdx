## Economist and Philanthropist

* Built Periyar Potteries, not for profit, but as a community initiative to provide livelihood and dignified work for rural artisans
* Founded Avilalayam on 10 acres of his property, a shelter and vocational learning centre, to support homeless women, offering residential facility with vocational training.
* Generous donation of his property (5 acres) to the church and on that land he built the Infant Jesus Church, Marampilly.  It is now a vibrant Parish community.
* Gifted large acres of his land in Malabar towards the Bhoodan Movement- an initiative started by Shri. Vinoba Bhave.
* Donated to the church his inherited property in Kuruvilangad called ‘Pakalomattom Parambu’, where five Archdeacons were buried. The Tharavad Palli (church) with the burial site, is now a place of pilgrimage.
